# Project Status

## Summary of Current State

1. **Core MCP Layer**:
   - Implemented in `mcp_layer.py`, handling protocol logic and provider routing.
2. **Provider Drivers**:
   - Implemented for Gemini,OpenAI, Cohere, and local LLMs in the `drivers` directory.
3. **Orchestration & Reasoning Layer**:
   - Partially implemented in `chain_of_thought.py`, but requires further development for multi-step reasoning.
4. **Front-End Client Interface**:
   - Implemented in `client.py`, providing a simple API for developers.
5. **Documentation**:
   - Comprehensive documentation exists for architecture, protocol, orchestration, provider drivers, and security.

## Suggested Next Steps

1. **Expand Orchestration Layer**:
   - Implement multi-step reasoning workflows in `chain_of_thought.py`.
   - Add support for context management and chaining of `MCPRequests`.
2. **Add More Provider Drivers**:
   - Implement drivers for additional LLM providers (e.g., Gemini, Anthropic).
3. **Enhance Security**:
   - Integrate a secure vault or secrets manager for credential storage.
   - Add rate limiting and quota enforcement.
4. **Improve Developer Experience**:
   - Add comprehensive examples and tutorials in the `docs` directory.
5. **Testing & Validation**:
   - Write unit and integration tests for all components.
   - Validate the system with real-world use cases.
