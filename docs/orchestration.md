# Orchestration & Reasoning Layer

The Orchestration & Reasoning Layer provides advanced features for managing complex LLM interactions through workflows, plugins, and chain-of-thought reasoning.

## Workflow Management

### Workflow Types

1. **Sequential Workflows**
   - Steps are executed in order
   - Each step can access results from previous steps
   - Supports conditional branching based on step results

2. **Parallel Workflows**
   - Multiple steps executed concurrently
   - Useful for comparing responses from different providers
   - Results are aggregated after all steps complete

3. **Hybrid Workflows**
   - Combines sequential and parallel execution
   - Supports complex orchestration patterns

### Workflow States

- `PENDING`: Workflow created but not started
- `RUNNING`: Currently executing
- `COMPLETED`: All steps finished successfully
- `FAILED`: One or more steps failed
- `PAUSED`: Execution temporarily halted

## Chain-of-Thought Orchestration

### Features

- Multi-step reasoning with intermediate results
- Context management across steps
- Prompt expansion and refinement
- Global or per-request configuration

### Implementation

```python
from universal_mcp_client import ChainOfThought

# Create a chain
chain = ChainOfThought(client)

# Define steps
steps = [
    {
        "name": "analyze",
        "prompt": "Analyze the problem: {input}"
    },
    {
        "name": "plan",
        "prompt": "Create a plan based on analysis: {analyze.result}"
    },
    {
        "name": "execute",
        "prompt": "Execute the plan: {plan.result}"
    }
]

# Execute chain
result = chain.solve(steps, input="How do I optimize this algorithm?")
```

## Plugin System

### Plugin Types

1. **Processor Plugins**
   - Transform input/output data
   - Example: PII anonymization, format conversion

2. **Provider Plugins**
   - Add new LLM providers
   - Example: Custom local LLM integration

3. **Workflow Plugins**
   - Add custom workflow steps
   - Example: Database operations, API calls

### Plugin Lifecycle

1. Registration

   ```python
   plugin_manager.register(MyCustomPlugin())
   ```

2. Initialization

   ```python
   plugin_manager.initialize("my_plugin")
   ```

3. Usage in Workflows

   ```python
   workflow.add_step({
       "name": "custom_step",
       "plugin": "my_plugin",
       "action": "process_data"
   })
   ```

4. Cleanup

   ```python
   plugin_manager.shutdown("my_plugin")
   ```

## Error Handling

- Step-level error handling with retry policies
- Workflow-level error recovery
- Plugin error isolation
- Detailed error reporting and logging

## Monitoring & Observability

- Step execution metrics
- Token usage tracking
- Performance monitoring
- Plugin health checks

## Best Practices

1. **Workflow Design**
   - Keep steps atomic and focused
   - Use meaningful step names
   - Include proper error handling
   - Document expected inputs/outputs

2. **Plugin Development**
   - Follow the plugin interface
   - Handle cleanup properly
   - Include proper error handling
   - Document configuration options

3. **Performance**
   - Use parallel execution when possible
   - Implement proper caching
   - Monitor resource usage
   - Optimize token usage
