# Security & Privacy

This document outlines the security measures and best practices for the OmniXy project.

## Credentials & Authentication

### Provider Credentials

- Store provider API keys in a secure vault (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
- Support environment variables with proper encryption
- Rotate credentials regularly
- Use separate credentials for development/staging/production

### Plugin Authentication

- Implement plugin signature verification
- Use secure token-based authentication for plugin communication
- Validate plugin sources and maintainers

## Data Protection

### Request/Response Security

- Use HTTPS/TLS 1.3+ for all remote calls
- Implement request signing for integrity
- Enable response verification

### PII Handling

- Implement PII detection and anonymization
- Support data masking plugins
- Provide audit trails for PII access

### Data Storage

- Encrypt data at rest
- Implement proper data retention policies
- Support secure data deletion

## Workflow Security

### Access Control

- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for workflows
- Support workflow-level permissions
- Enable audit logging for workflow access

### State Management

- Secure storage of workflow state
- Encrypt sensitive workflow data
- Implement state validation

### Resource Protection

- Set resource usage limits per workflow
- Implement timeout mechanisms
