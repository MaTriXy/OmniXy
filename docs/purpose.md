# Is MCP Limited to Only Using Claude AI Models?

No, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) is **not limited to only using Claude AI models**. It is designed as an **open and model-agnostic protocol** that facilitates seamless integration between Large Language Models (LLMs) and external data sources, tools, and services. Here's why:

- **Generalized Design**: The MCP specification describes itself as a protocol for connecting LLMs—broadly defined—with the context they need to function effectively. It uses generic terms like "language models" and outlines features such as prompts, resources, and tools, which are applicable to any LLM, not just Claude AI models developed by Anthropic.

- **No Claude-Specific Requirements**: Throughout the specification—including sections on architecture, base protocol, client features, and server features—there are no explicit mentions of requirements or constraints that tie MCP exclusively to Claude AI. Instead, it relies on a standardized communication framework (JSON-RPC 2.0), which is widely compatible with various systems and models.

- **Evidence of Flexibility**: External references, such as posts on X, highlight MCP being used with diverse models and platforms, including open LLMs, OpenAI, and Google DeepMind Gemini. For example, one use case involves building modular AI agents that leverage MCP with multiple LLM providers, demonstrating its versatility beyond Claude AI.

- **Client-Server Examples**: The specification and related discussions also describe MCP clients (e.g., Claude Code) connecting to servers like GitHub, Sentry, or web search services. This suggests that MCP is built to interact with a variety of services and models, not just a single proprietary one.

In summary, MCP's design and real-world applications indicate that it is a **flexible, universal protocol** intended to work with any language model, not restricted to Claude AI.

## Can I Create a Universal MCP Client as a Python Package?

Yes, you **can create a universal MCP client as a Python package** that can be coded into any application you build and connect to as many servers as you want. The MCP specification supports this concept through its architecture and design principles. Here's how and why this is feasible:

### Why It’s Possible

1. **Client-Server Architecture**:
   - MCP uses a **client-host-server model** where clients can connect to multiple servers. The specification notes that hosts can run multiple client instances, and clients can interact with various servers offering different services (e.g., data resources, tools, or prompts).
   - This architecture allows a single client—such as your Python package—to dynamically hook into as many MCP-compliant servers as needed.

2. **Standardized Protocol**:
   - MCP is built on **JSON-RPC 2.0**, a lightweight and widely adopted remote procedure call protocol. This ensures that your Python client can communicate consistently with any server that adheres to the MCP specification, regardless of the specific services or models the server supports.

3. **Dynamic Capability Negotiation**:
   - The lifecycle section of the specification describes an **initialization phase** where clients and servers negotiate capabilities and protocol versions. This means your universal client can adapt to different servers by agreeing on supported features at runtime, making it flexible across diverse implementations.

4. **Modular Server Features**:
   - Servers in MCP provide features like prompts, resources, and tools, which are optional and extensible. Your client can choose which server features to utilize, allowing it to connect to servers with varying purposes (e.g., a database server, a web search server, or an LLM inference server).

5. **Real-World Precedents**:
   - Examples from X posts show MCP clients being integrated into applications like Slack or CLI tools managing SQLite databases via an Anthropic MCP server.
   These cases illustrate that clients can be built as reusable components embedded in different environments, supporting the idea of a universal Python package.

### How to Implement It

In python we can use OmniXy.

We aim to provide the following features:

- **Build a Core Client Library**:
  - JSON-RPC 2.0 communication to send requests, receive responses, and handle notifications as outlined in the base protocol.
  - Include support for the MCP lifecycle (e.g., initialization, capability negotiation).

- **Server Connection Management**:
  - Design the client to register and manage connections to multiple servers, allowing developers to hook servers dynamically via configuration or API calls.

- **Flexible API**:
  - Providing methods for interacting with common MCP features (e.g., sending prompts, accessing resources) while allowing customization for server-specific capabilities.

- **Integrate into Applications**:
  - Package the client as a Python module (e.g., `pip install OmniXy`).

#### Considerations and Challenges

Some of the key factors we keep in mind:

- **Server Variability**: Different MCP servers may implement subsets of features or custom extensions. Your client should be robust enough to handle varying capabilities, perhaps by querying server metadata during initialization and adapting accordingly.

- **Protocol Versions**: The initialization phase ensures compatibility, but if servers use different MCP versions, your client may need to support fallback behaviors or version-specific logic.

- **Security**: MCP enables arbitrary data access and code execution paths, as noted in the specification. When connecting to multiple servers, your client must enforce proper authorization, validate server trustworthiness, and secure data transmission (e.g., via TLS).

### Conclusion

- **MCP and Claude AI**: The Model Context Protocol is **not limited to Claude AI models**. It is a model-agnostic, open protocol designed to work with any LLM, making it a versatile tool for integrating language models with external systems.

- **Universal MCP Client**: You **can absolutely create a universal MCP client as a Python package**. Its client-server architecture, standardized communication, and flexible design allow you to embed the client into any application and connect it to multiple servers. With careful handling of server differences and security, this client could enhance a wide range of AI-driven applications.

By leveraging MCP’s flexibility, Our Python package serves as a powerful bridge between applications and an ecosystem of MCP servers, unlocking diverse functionalities for developers.

Enjoy!
